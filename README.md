# My Fuel &middot; [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/89056131-bbd7-4e42-bdd0-5acf3a4e19a5/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/myfuel/deploys)

My Fuel is a simple web app to track the fuel consumption of my cars. It's intention was to implement a serverless application with [Angular](https://angular.io), [Clarity](https://clarity.design), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and [Fauna](https://fauna.com) and learn some new fancy stuff.

The app is designed with the mobile first approach, as it is mostly used on mobile devices at the fuel station.

## Usage

My Fuel runs on https://myfuel.ctor.io and is hosted by Netlify (thanks!). If you would like to get your own login, feel free to [contact me](https://www.aquasonic.ch). If you just want to play around a bit, you could use the test user id `252455108115169810` (keep in mind that the demo user data will be visible to anyone).
